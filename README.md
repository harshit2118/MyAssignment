All logic test solutions are in Logic Test folder which
are done in python

Other then that to run the front end fill use following steps:
1)Store remaining files and folders except Logic Test in seperate
  folder 
2) Install json server by using:
    "npm i json-server" command in directory where you stored font-end file.
3) Now just run "npm run start-dev" in given directory.

Please notify me in any problem.
Thanks
